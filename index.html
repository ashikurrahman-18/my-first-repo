    <h2>My First Journey</h2>
    <p id="first_journey">I have loved travel for as long as I can remember. My parents instilled that in me at a very young age. Our summers, and a lot of our weekends, were spent travelling in our RV. We did a lot of local trips here in ALBERTA but also went on some long haul journeys. We drove to ALASKA, across Canada, and to Southern California, just to name a few. I loved seeing new places and learning about the history and culture. Social Studies was always my favourite subject in school.</p>

    <h2>My second Journey</h2>
    <p id="second_journey">The Pantheon was first built in 27 BC by Marcus Agrippa (whose father-in-law was Augustus). The temple was rebuilt around AD 120 by Emperor Hadrian but Agrippa’s name was left inscribed over the entrance. The Pantheon is famous for its extraordinary dome, the largest masonry vault ever built. It’s considered the most important achievement of Ancient Roman architecture.</p>

    <h2>My Third Journey</h2>
    <p id="third_journey">I tend to prefer travelling independently to places that have a mix of beautiful landscapes and historic sites. I love to visit ARCHAEOLOGICAL SITES and spend time outdoors hiking, biking, and boating. It’s really hard to convince me to go to a beach somewhere and do nothing but lay around for a week. I can handle maybe a day or two, but after that I need to get active and go out exploring! I also crave to see a country in depth. I am not a fan of the 10 countries in 10 days type of tours (I hate feeling rushed and missing out on places). And budget travel isn’t my thing either. I like a little bit of luxury at the end of the day!</p>
